# 🔢 Python CLI Calculator

This is my basic **Python command-line calculator** project created for the **Python Developer Internship Task 1**.

It performs basic math operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` using user input from the terminal.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Build a calculator that runs in the terminal
- Takes input from the user
- Uses functions for each operation
- Loops until the user decides to exit

---

## 💻 Tools Used

- Python (for programming)
- VS Code (for writing code)
- Terminal / Command Prompt (for running the app)

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Each operation (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) is written as a separate function
- Uses a `while True` loop so the calculator runs continuously
- Has proper error handling using `try` and `except` for invalid input
- Shows a custom message when user tries to divide by zero

## 👇 Sample Output

```bash
📟 Welcome to the CLI Calculator
Operations available: +  -  *  /
Enter first number: 10
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
✅ Result: 50.0
Do you want to continue? (yes/no): no
👋 Exiting Calculator. Goodbye!
